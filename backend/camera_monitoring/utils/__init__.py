"""
Utility modules for camera monitoring.

This package provides utility functions that may be needed
by the camera monitoring module. Currently empty as all
geometry/math utilities are implemented inline within the
detector modules (face_analyzer.py, gaze_estimator.py) for
better encapsulation and to avoid unnecessary dependencies.

Future utilities can be added here as needed.
