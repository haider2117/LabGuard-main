# Python Dependencies for Camera Monitoring Module
# LabGuard - Camera-Based Monitoring
#
# IMPORTANT: Python 3.9-3.11 is recommended for full compatibility
# Python 3.12+ may have compatibility issues with MediaPipe
# If using Python 3.12+, you may need to use newer package versions

# Computer Vision
opencv-python>=4.8.0,<5.0.0

# Face Detection and Landmarks
# Note: MediaPipe 0.10.9 requires Python 3.8-3.11
# For Python 3.12+, try: mediapipe>=0.10.9 (may need to build from source)
mediapipe>=0.10.9

# Object Detection (YOLOv8n)
ultralytics>=8.0.0

# Numerical Computing
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0

# Image Processing
Pillow>=10.0.0

# Installation Instructions:
# 1. For Python 3.9-3.11: python -m pip install -r python_requirements.txt
# 2. For Python 3.12+: May need to install packages individually and use compatible versions
# 3. If MediaPipe fails, try: python -m pip install mediapipe --no-build-isolation
